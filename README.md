# WorldMusic
Repo for Supercrunchers project
Makes use of R, spotify information, spotifyr as a wrapper for retireve information, and shiny to create web page. 

For running this application you need to install shiny on your instance of R. package.install("shiny")
After succesfully installing shiny library run the following command in your console:

runGitHub( "WorldMusic", "arrazolan")


if this not works probably try installing the following libraries:

library(readxl)
library(spotifyr)
library(dplyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(plotly)
library(rworldmap)
library(shiny)
library(shinythemes)
library(sp)

UPDATE: for macusers this program will probably not work, however try installing xquartz library
